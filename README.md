### FILE NAMING CONVENTION

1. Modules should be placed in `src/modules`.
2. Utils should be placed in `src/utils`.

2. Precommit hooks are defined for `server` project.

### CODE SPECIFICS
1. Use `@Inject()` before injected services.
2. Always use upper-case `@Decorators`, eg. `prop()` from `@typegoose/typegoose` should be imported as `Property`. Change the names of imports to unique.
3. Use relative imports.
4. Use single quotes.
5. Use semicolons.
6. Use max line width set to 120 chars.
